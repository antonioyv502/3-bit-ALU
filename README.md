This project implements a 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations determined by a 3-bit select input and sets output flags such as carry out and zero. The design was verified using a testbench to simulate and validate the ALUâ€™s functionality, achieving 100% correctness across 8 different test cases.
