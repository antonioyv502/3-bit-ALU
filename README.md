# 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

## Description
This project implements a 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog.  
The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations determined by a 3-bit select input and sets output flags such as carry out and zero.  
The design was verified using a testbench to simulate and validate the ALUâ€™s functionality, achieving 100% correctness across 8 different test cases.

## Features
- 3-bit inputs and outputs
- Supports addition, subtraction, AND, OR, equality, less than, and greater than operations
- Output flags: Carry out, Zero, Equal, Less than, Greater than
